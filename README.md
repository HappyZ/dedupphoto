# Photo Deduplicator

Photo Deduplicator is a tool designed to assist Synology NAS users in deduplicating photos, a feature not inherently provided by Synology Photo. This tool leverages the PHash algorithm for accurate deduplication while ensuring safety by not auto-deleting photos, instead offering a web server for manual deletion.

## Features

- **Deduplication**: Utilizes the PHash algorithm for accurate identificatio∆ín and removal of duplicate photos.
- **Safety**: Does not auto-delete photos to prevent accidental loss; provides a web server for manual deletion.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a straightforward interface for managing duplicate photos (not pretty but works).

## Build from Source
