# Photo Deduplicator

Photo Deduplicator is a tool designed to assist Synology NAS users in deduplicating photos, a feature not inherently provided by Synology Photo. This tool leverages the PHash algorithm for accurate deduplication while ensuring safety by not auto-deleting photos, instead offering a web server for manual deletion.

## Features

- **Deduplication**: Utilizes the PHash algorithm for accurate identificatio∆ín and removal of duplicate photos.
- **Safety**: Does not auto-delete photos to prevent accidental loss; provides a web server for manual deletion.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a straightforward interface for managing duplicate photos (not pretty but works).

Note the trash bin folder is provided to actually move the photo to the trash bin folder instead of actually deleting it.
You can change the command when launching the docker image by removing `--trashbin` so it will actually delete.

## Build from Source

To build the Photo Deduplicator from source, follow these steps:

```bash
docker build -t happyzyz/dedupphoto:latest .
